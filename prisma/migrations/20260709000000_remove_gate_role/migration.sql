-- Completely remove the GATE role code that was added to the database out-of-band.
-- Postgres does not support dropping a value from an enum, so we recreate the
-- "role_code" enum without GATE and swap the column over.

-- 1. Delete any role assignments and role rows using GATE (if present).
DELETE FROM "user_roles"
WHERE "role_id" IN (SELECT "id" FROM "roles" WHERE "code" = 'GATE');

DELETE FROM "roles" WHERE "code" = 'GATE';

-- 2. Rebuild the enum without GATE.
ALTER TYPE "role_code" RENAME TO "role_code_old";

CREATE TYPE "role_code" AS ENUM ('ADMIN', 'ORGANISER', 'CO_ORGANISER', 'MEMBER', 'VOLUNTEER');

ALTER TABLE "roles"
  ALTER COLUMN "code" TYPE "role_code"
  USING ("code"::text::"role_code");

DROP TYPE "role_code_old";
